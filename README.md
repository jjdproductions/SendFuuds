## Overview

### App Description
Have you ever had food that you couldn't finish, and just ended up throwing it away? Chances are, you have. 

**JJDProductions** aims to solve this great problem in the world today with **SendFuuds**.

**SendFuuds** is an application where users can get notified that their food is about to expire and are given an option to share it with friends.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Media/Personal use
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for iOS users and will work similar to apps like [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en).
- **Story:** Analyzes users music choices, and connects them to other users with similar choices. The user can then decide to message this person and befriend them if wanted.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app. We all need to be aware of the food that we waste each day!
- **Habit:** This app could be used more often by people who cook to ensure that the groceries they buy do not expire. 
- **Scope:** We will start by having users around UC Irvine use the application, but we expect that this application can be used by people around the world.
